    "### Challenge\n",
    "We recorded electrophysiology data and accelerometer data during a self-paced hand tapping task. We are interested in the spectral differences between the moments where the patient moved, and the movement where they did not move.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "- recommend packages: `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, but no need to you use these!\n",
    "- acc and ephys do not have the same sampling frequency\n",
    "- figure out pragmatically how many movements where performed, you can choose to pragmatically define every half a second after movement onset as \"movement\"\n",
    "- \"dopa_time\" refers to the overall time in the protocol\n",
    "- perform a time-frequency-decomposition using a bipolar signal subtracting \"LFP_R_01\" from \"LFP_R_01\"\n",
    "- describe frequencies below 50 Hz\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important\n",
    "Make sure to comment sufficiently, so we can understand what and why you are doing!"
